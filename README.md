A place to go to when inquiring an informative decision for a smoothie you are desiring.

Models:
#1 The first model is a standard blog post and its functionality is for the user to input a author, image, a description box, etc., for the featured content of the post.


### Approach & Team Best Practices :
Every at 10am our team met to discuss responsibilities for each team member, the progress of the project, challenges we faced, and project goals. Throughout the day each team member was available on slack in case another team member needed support/help debugging. If the project plan needed to be restructured it was discussed with the whole team before executing major changes.
